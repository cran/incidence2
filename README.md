incidence2 is an R package that implements functions and classes to compute,
handle and visualise *incidence* from linelist data. It refocusses the scope of
the original [incidence](https://cran.r-project.org/package=incidence) package.
Unlike the original package, incidence2 concentrates only on the initial
calculation, manipulation and plotting of the resultant *incidence* objects.

## Installing the package

You can install the latest release of incidence2 from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` {.r}
install.packages("incidence2")
```

## Vignettes

A detailed introduction to incidence2 can be found in the included vignette
