# incidence2

incidence2 is an R package that implements functions and classes to
compute, handle and visualise *incidence* from linelist data. It
refocusses the scope of the original
[incidence](https://cran.r-project.org/package=incidence) package.
Unlike the original package, incidence2 concentrates only on the initial
calculation, manipulation and plotting of the resultant *incidence*
objects.

## Installing the package

You can install incidence2 from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
with:

``` r
install.packages("incidence2")
```

## Vignettes

An overview of incidence2 is provided in the vignette distributed with
the package:

- `vignette("incidence2", package = "incidence2")`
